```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      message = FALSE)
```

```{r library}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
tb_long <- read_rds(here("data","tb_long.rds"))
tb_long
```

### Q1: Recode the sex variable to have values “male” and “female” instead of “m” and “f” (hint: use if_else)

```{r recode}
tb_long <- tb_long %>% mutate(sex = if_else(sex == "m", "male", "female"))
tb_long
```

### Q2: Use spread to put the count values into the columns male and female, then create a new variable called diff which contains the difference between the male and female counts.

```{r spread}
tb_wide <- tb_long %>%
  spread(key = "sex", value = "count") %>%
  mutate(diff = female - male)

tb_wide
```
